The Order of the Phoenix, led by Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody, arrives to take Harry to
his new home at the Weasleys’ house, the Burrow. Six of Harry’s friends take
Polyjuice Potion to disguise themselves as Harry and act as decoys, and they all fly
off in different directions. The Death Eaters, alerted to their departure by Snape,
attack Harry and his friends. Voldemort chases Harry down, but Harry’s wand fends
Voldemort off, seemingly without Harry’s help.
