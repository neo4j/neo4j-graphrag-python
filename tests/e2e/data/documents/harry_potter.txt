At Malfoy Manor, Snape tells Voldemort the date that Harry’s friends are planning to
move him from the house on Privet Drive to a new safe location, so that Voldemort
can capture Harry en route.

As Harry packs to leave Privet Drive, he reads two obituaries for Dumbledore, both
of which make him think that he didn’t know Dumbledore as well as he should have.
Downstairs, he bids good-bye to the Dursleys for the final time, as the threat of
Voldemort forces them to go into hiding themselves.

The Order of the Phoenix, led by Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody, arrives to take Harry to
his new home at the Weasleys’ house, the Burrow. Six of Harry’s friends take
Polyjuice Potion to disguise themselves as Harry and act as decoys, and they all fly
off in different directions. The Death Eaters, alerted to their departure by Snape,
attack Harry and his friends. Voldemort chases Harry down, but Harry’s wand fends
Voldemort off, seemingly without Harry’s help.
