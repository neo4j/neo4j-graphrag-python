User Guide: Knowledge Graph Builder
###################################


This page provides information about how to create a Knowledge Graph from
unstructured data.

.. warning::

    This feature is still experimental. API changes and bug fixes are expected.


******************
Pipeline Structure
******************

A Knowledge Graph (KG) construction pipeline requires a few components (some of the below components are optional):

- **Data loader**: extract text from files (PDFs, ...).
- **Text splitter**: split the text into smaller pieces of text (chunks), manageable by the LLM context window (token limit).
- **Chunk embedder** (optional): compute the chunk embeddings.
- **Schema builder**: provide a schema to ground the LLM extracted entities and relations and obtain an easily navigable KG.
- **Lexical graph builder**: build the lexical graph (Document, Chunk and their relationships) (optional).
- **Entity and relation extractor**: extract relevant entities and relations from the text.
- **Knowledge Graph writer**: save the identified entities and relations.
- **Entity resolver**: merge similar entities into a single node.

This package contains the interface and implementations for each of these components, which are detailed in the following sections.

To see an end-to-end example of a Knowledge Graph construction pipeline,
visit the `example folder <https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-graphrag-python/blob/main/examples/>`_
in the project's GitHub repository.


******************
Simple KG Pipeline
******************

The simplest way to begin building a KG from unstructured data using this package
is utilizing the `SimpleKGPipeline` interface:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.pipeline.kg_builder import SimpleKGPipeline

    kg_builder = SimpleKGPipeline(
        llm=llm, # an LLMInterface for Entity and Relation extraction
        driver=neo4j_driver,  # a neo4j driver to write results to graph
        embedder=embedder,  # an Embedder for chunks
        from_pdf=True,   # set to False if parsing an already extracted text
    )
    await kg_builder.run_async(file_path=str(file_path))
    # await kg_builder.run_async(text="my text")  # if using from_pdf=False


See:

- :ref:`Using Another LLM Model` to learn how to instantiate the `llm`
- :ref:`Embedders` to learn how to instantiate the `embedder`


The following section outlines the configuration parameters for this class.

Customizing the SimpleKGPipeline
================================

Graph Schema
------------

It is possible to guide the LLM by supplying a list of entities, relationships,
and instructions on how to connect them. However, note that the extracted graph
may not fully adhere to these guidelines. Entities and relationships can be
represented as either simple strings (for their labels) or dictionaries. If using
a dictionary, it must include a label key and can optionally include description
and properties keys, as shown below:

.. code:: python

    ENTITIES = [
        # entities can be defined with a simple label...
        "Person",
        # ... or with a dict if more details are needed,
        # such as a description:
        {"label": "House", "description": "Family the person belongs to"},
        # or a list of properties the LLM will try to attach to the entity:
        {"label": "Planet", "properties": [{"name": "weather", "type": "STRING"}]},
    ]
    # same thing for relationships:
    RELATIONS = [
        "PARENT_OF",
        {
            "label": "HEIR_OF",
            "description": "Used for inheritor relationship between father and sons",
        },
        {"label": "RULES", "properties": [{"name": "fromYear", "type": "INTEGER"}]},
    ]

The `potential_schema` is defined by a list of triplet in the format:
`(source_node_label, relationship_label, target_node_label)`. For instance:


.. code:: python

    POTENTIAL_SCHEMA = [
        ("Person", "PARENT_OF", "Person"),
        ("Person", "HEIR_OF", "House"),
        ("House", "RULES", "Planet"),
    ]

This schema information can be provided to the `SimpleKGBuilder` as demonstrated below:

.. code:: python

    kg_builder = SimpleKGPipeline(
        # ...
        entities=ENTITIES,
        relations=RELATIONS,
        potential_schema=POTENTIAL_SCHEMA,
        # ...
    )

Prompt Template, Lexical Graph Config and Error Behavior
--------------------------------------------------------

These parameters are part of the `EntityAndRelationExtractor` component.
For detailed information, refer to the section on :ref:`Entity and Relation Extractor`.
They are also accessible via the `SimpleKGPipeline` interface.

.. code:: python

    kg_builder = SimpleKGPipeline(
        # ...
        prompt_template="",
        lexical_graph_config=my_config,
        on_error="RAISE",
        # ...
    )

Skip Entity Resolution
----------------------

By default, after each run, an Entity Resolution step is performed to merge nodes
that share the same label and name property. To disable this behavior, adjust
the following parameter:

.. code:: python

    kg_builder = SimpleKGPipeline(
        # ...
        perform_entity_resolution=False,
        # ...
    )

Neo4j Database
--------------

To write to a non-default Neo4j database, specify the database name using this parameter:

.. code:: python

    kg_builder = SimpleKGPipeline(
        # ...
        neo4j_database="myDb",
        # ...
    )

Using Custom Components
-----------------------

For advanced customization or when using a custom implementation, you can pass
instances of specific components to the `SimpleKGPipeline`. The components that can
customized at the moment are:

- `text_splitter`: must be an instance of :ref:`TextSplitter`
- `pdf_loader`: must be an instance of :ref:`PdfLoader`
- `kg_writer`: must be an instance of :ref:`KGWriter`

For instance, the following code can be used to customize the chunk size and
chunk overlap in the text splitter component:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.text_splitters.fixed_size_splitter import (
        FixedSizeSplitter,
    )

    text_splitter = FixedSizeSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=100)

    kg_builder = SimpleKGPipeline(
        # ...
        text_splitter=text_splitter,
        # ...
    )


Using a Config file
===================

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.pipeline.config.runner import PipelineRunner

    file_path = "my_config.json"

    pipeline = PipelineRunner.from_config_file(file_path)
    await pipeline.run({"text": "my text"})


The config file can be written in either JSON or YAML format.

Here is an example of a base configuration file in JSON format:

.. code:: json

    {
        "version_": 1,
        "template_": "SimpleKGPipeline",
        "neo4j_config": {},
        "llm_config": {},
        "embedder_config": {}
    }

And like this in YAML:

.. code:: yaml

    version_: 1
    template_: SimpleKGPipeline
    neo4j_config:
    llm_config:
    embedder_config:


Defining a Neo4j Driver
-----------------------

Below is an example of configuring a Neo4j driver in a JSON configuration file:

.. code:: json

    {
        "neo4j_config": {
            "params_": {
                "uri": "bolt://...",
                "user": "neo4j",
                "password": "password"
            }
        }
    }

Same for YAML:

.. code:: yaml

    neo4j_config:
        params_:
            uri: bolt://
            user: neo4j
            password: password

In some cases, it may be necessary to avoid hard-coding sensitive values,
such as passwords or API keys, to ensure security. To address this, the configuration
parser supports parameter resolution methods.

Parameter resolution
--------------------

To instruct the configuration parser to read a parameter from an environment variable,
use the following syntax:

.. code:: json

    {
        "neo4j_config": {
            "params_": {
                "uri": "bolt://...",
                "user": "neo4j",
                "password": {
                    "resolver_": "ENV",
                    "var_": "NEO4J_PASSWORD"
                }
            }
        }
    }

And for YAML:

.. code:: yaml

    neo4j_config:
      params_:
        uri: bolt://
        user: neo4j
        password:
          resolver_: ENV
          var_: NEO4J_PASSWORD

- The `resolver_=ENV` key is mandatory and its value cannot be altered.
- The `var_` key specifies the name of the environment variable to be read.

This syntax can be applied to all parameters.


Defining an LLM
----------------

Below is an example of configuring an LLM in a JSON configuration file:

.. code:: json

    {
        "llm_config": {
            "class_": "OpenAILLM",
            "params_": {
                "mode_name": "gpt-4o",
                "api_key": {
                    "resolver_": "ENV",
                    "var_": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
                },
                "model_params": {
                    "temperature": 0,
                    "max_tokens": 2000,
                    "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}
                }
            }
        }
    }

And the equivalent YAML:

.. code:: yaml

    llm_config:
      class_: OpenAILLM
      params_:
        model_name: gpt-4o
        api_key:
          resolver_: ENV
          var_: OPENAI_API_KEY
        model_params:
          temperature: 0
          max_tokens: 2000
          response_format:
            type: json_object

- The `class_` key specifies the path to the class to be instantiated.
- The `params_` key contains the parameters to be passed to the class constructor.

When using an LLM implementation provided by this package, the full path in the `class_` key
can be omitted (the parser will automatically import from `neo4j_graphrag.llm`).
For custom implementations, the full path must be explicitly specified,
for example: `my_package.my_llm.MyLLM`.

.. warning::

    Check the :ref:`installation` section to make sure you have the required dependencies installed when using an LLM.


Defining an Embedder
--------------------

The same principles apply to `embedder_config`:

.. code:: json

    {
        "embedder_config": {
            "class_": "OpenAIEmbeddings",
            "params_": {
                "mode": "text-embedding-ada-002",
                "api_key": {
                    "resolver_": "ENV",
                    "var_": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
                }
            }
        }
    }

Or the YAML version:

.. code:: yaml

    embedder_config:
      class_: OpenAIEmbeddings
      params_:
        api_key:
          resolver_: ENV
          var_: OPENAI_API_KEY

- For embedder implementations from this package, the full path can be omitted in the `class_` key (the parser will import from `neo4j_graphrag.embeddings`).
- For custom implementations, the full path must be provided, for example: `my_package.my_embedding.MyEmbedding`.


Other configuration
-------------------

The other parameters exposed in the :ref:`SimpleKGPipeline` can also be configured
within the configuration file.

.. code:: json

    {
        "from_pdf": false,
        "perform_entity_resolution": true,
        "neo4j_database": "myDb",
        "on_error": "IGNORE",
        "prompt_template": "...",
        "entities": [
            "Person",
            {
                "label": "House",
                "description": "Family the person belongs to",
                "properties": [
                    {"name": "name", "type": "STRING"}
                ]
            },
            {
                "label": "Planet",
                "properties": [
                    {"name": "name", "type": "STRING"},
                    {"name": "weather", "type": "STRING"}
                ]
            }
        ],
        "relations": [
            "PARENT_OF",
            {
                "label": "HEIR_OF",
                "description": "Used for inheritor relationship between father and sons"
            },
            {
                "label": "RULES",
                "properties": [
                    {"name": "fromYear", "type": "INTEGER"}
                ]
            }
        ],
        "potential_schema": [
            ["Person", "PARENT_OF", "Person"],
            ["Person", "HEIR_OF", "House"],
            ["House", "RULES", "Planet"]
        ],
        "lexical_graph_config": {
            "chunk_node_label": "TextPart"
        }
    }


or in YAML:

.. code:: yaml

    from_pdf: false
    perform_entity_resolution: true
    neo4j_database: myDb
    on_error: IGNORE
    prompt_template: ...
    entities:
      - label: Person
      - label: House
        description: Family the person belongs to
        properties:
          - name: name
            type: STRING
      - label: Planet
        properties:
          - name: name
            type: STRING
          - name: weather
            type: STRING
    relations:
      - label: PARENT_OF
      - label: HEIR_OF
        description: Used for inheritor relationship between father and sons
      - label: RULES
        properties:
          - name: fromYear
            type: INTEGER
    potential_schema:
      - ["Person", "PARENT_OF", "Person"]
      - ["Person", "HEIR_OF", "House"]
      - ["House", "RULES", "Planet"]
    lexical_graph_config:
        chunk_node_label: TextPart


It is also possible to further customize components, with a syntax similar to the one
used for `llm_config` or `embedder_config`:

.. code:: json

    {
        "text_splitter": {
            "class_": "text_splitters.FixedSizeSplitter",
            "params_": {
                "chunk_size": 500,
                "chunk_overlap": 100
            }
        }

    }

The YAML equivalent:

.. code:: yaml

    text_splitter:
      class_: text_splitters.fixed_size_splitter.FixedSizeSplitter
      params_:
        chunk_size: 100
        chunk_overlap: 10

The `neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components` prefix will be appended automatically
if needed.


**********************************
Knowledge Graph Builder Components
**********************************

Below is a list of the different components available in this package and how to use them.

Each of these components can be run individually:

.. code:: python

    import asyncio
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.pdf_loader import PdfLoader
    my_component = PdfLoader()
    asyncio.run(my_component.run("my_file.pdf"))


They can also be used within a pipeline:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.pipeline import Pipeline
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.pdf_loader import PdfLoader
    pipeline = Pipeline()
    my_component = PdfLoader()
    pipeline.add_component(my_component, "component_name")


Data Loader
============

Data loaders start from a file path and return the text extracted from this file.

This package currently supports text extraction from PDFs:

.. code:: python

    from pathlib import Path
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.pdf_loader import PdfLoader

    loader = PdfLoader()
    await loader.run(path=Path("my_file.pdf"))

To implement your own loader, use the `DataLoader` interface:

.. code:: python

    from pathlib import Path
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.pdf_loader import DataLoader, PdfDocument

    class MyDataLoader(DataLoader):
        async def run(self, path: Path) -> PdfDocument:
            # process file in `path`
            return PdfDocument(text="text")



Text Splitter
==============

Document splitters, as the name indicate, split documents into smaller chunks
that can be processed within the LLM token limits:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.text_splitters.fixed_size_splitter import FixedSizeSplitter

    splitter = FixedSizeSplitter(chunk_size=4000, chunk_overlap=200, approximate=False)
    splitter.run(text="Hello World. Life is beautiful.")

.. note::

    `approximate` flag is by default set to True to ensure clean chunk start and end (i.e. avoid words cut in the middle) whenever it is possible.

Wrappers for LangChain and LlamaIndex text splitters are included in this package:

.. code:: python

    from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.text_splitters.langchain import LangChainTextSplitterAdapter
    splitter = LangChainTextSplitterAdapter(
        CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=4000, chunk_overlap=200, separator=".")
    )
    await splitter.run(text="Hello World. Life is beautiful.")


Also see :ref:`langchaintextsplitteradapter` and :ref:`llamaindextextsplitteradapter`.

To implement a custom text splitter, the `TextSplitter` interface can be used:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.text_splitters.base import TextSplitter
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.types import TextChunks, TextChunk


    class MyTextSplitter(TextSplitter):

        def __init__(self, separator: str = ".") -> None:
            self.separator = separator

        async def run(self, text: str) -> TextChunks:
             return TextChunks(
                 chunks=[
                     TextChunk(text=text_chunk)
                     for text_chunk in text.split(self.separator)
                 ]
             )


Chunk Embedder
==============

In order to embed the chunks' texts (to be used in vector search RAG), one can use the
`TextChunkEmbedder` component, which rely on the :ref:`Embedder` interface.

Example usage:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.embedder import TextChunkEmbedder
    from neo4j_graphrag.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
    text_chunk_embedder = TextChunkEmbedder(embedder=OpenAIEmbeddings())
    await text_chunk_embedder.run(text_chunks=TextChunks(chunks=[TextChunk(text="my_text")]))

.. note::

    To use OpenAI (embedding or LLM), the `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be in the env vars, for instance using:

    .. code:: python

        import os
        os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."


If OpenAI is not an option, see :ref:`embedders` to learn how to use other supported embedders.

The embeddings are added to each chunk metadata, and will be saved as a Chunk node property in the graph if
`create_lexical_graph` is enabled in the `EntityRelationExtractor` (keep reading).

.. _lexical-graph-builder:

Lexical Graph Builder
=====================

Once the chunks are extracted and embedded (if required), a graph can be created.

The **lexical graph** contains:

- `Document` node: represent the processed document and have a `path` property.
- `Chunk` nodes: represent the text chunks. They have a `text` property and, if computed, an `embedding` property.
- `NEXT_CHUNK` relationships between one chunk node and the next one in the document. It can be used to enhance the context in a RAG application.
- `FROM_DOCUMENT` relationship between each chunk and the document it was built from.

Example usage:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.pipeline.components.lexical_graph_builder import LexicalGraphBuilder
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.pipeline.components.types import LexicalGraphConfig

    lexical_graph_builder = LexicalGraphBuilder(config=LexicalGraphConfig())
    graph = await lexical_graph_builder.run(
        text_chunks=TextChunks(chunks=[
            TextChunk(text="some text", index=0),
            TextChunk(text="some text", index=1),
        ]),
        document_info=DocumentInfo(path="my_document.pdf"),
    )

See :ref:`kg-writer-section` to learn how to write the resulting nodes and relationships to Neo4j.


Neo4j Chunk Reader
==================

The Neo4j chunk reader component is used to read text chunks from Neo4j. Text chunks can be created
by the lexical graph builder or another process.

.. code:: python

    import neo4j
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.neo4j_reader import Neo4jChunkReader
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.types import LexicalGraphConfig

    reader = Neo4jChunkReader(driver)
    result = await reader.run()


Configure node labels and relationship types
---------------------------------------------

Optionally, the document and chunk node labels can be configured using a `LexicalGraphConfig` object:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.neo4j_reader import Neo4jChunkReader
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.types import LexicalGraphConfig, TextChunks

    # optionally, define a LexicalGraphConfig object
    # shown below with the default values
    config = LexicalGraphConfig(
        chunk_node_label="Chunk",
        document_node_label="Document",
        chunk_to_document_relationship_type="PART_OF_DOCUMENT",
        next_chunk_relationship_type="NEXT_CHUNK",
        node_to_chunk_relationship_type="PART_OF_CHUNK",
        chunk_embedding_property="embeddings",
    )
    reader = Neo4jChunkReader(driver)
    result = await reader.run(lexical_graph_config=config)


Schema Builder
==============

The schema is used to try and ground the LLM to a list of possible entities and relations of interest.
So far, schema must be manually created by specifying:

- **Entities** the LLM should look for in the text, including their properties (name and type).
- **Relations** of interest between these entities, including the relation properties (name and type).
- **Triplets** to define the start (source) and end (target) entity types for each relation.

Here is a code block illustrating these concepts:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.schema import (
        SchemaBuilder,
        SchemaEntity,
        SchemaProperty,
        SchemaRelation,
    )

    schema_builder = SchemaBuilder()

    await schema_builder.run(
        entities=[
            SchemaEntity(
                label="Person",
                properties=[
                    SchemaProperty(name="name", type="STRING"),
                    SchemaProperty(name="place_of_birth", type="STRING"),
                    SchemaProperty(name="date_of_birth", type="DATE"),
                ],
            ),
            SchemaEntity(
                label="Organization",
                properties=[
                    SchemaProperty(name="name", type="STRING"),
                    SchemaProperty(name="country", type="STRING"),
                ],
            ),
        ],
        relations=[
            SchemaRelation(
                label="WORKED_ON",
            ),
            SchemaRelation(
                label="WORKED_FOR",
            ),
        ],
        possible_schema=[
            ("Person", "WORKED_ON", "Field"),
            ("Person", "WORKED_FOR", "Organization"),
        ],
    )

After validation, this schema is saved in a `SchemaConfig` object, whose dict representation is passed
to the LLM.


Entity and Relation Extractor
=============================

This component is responsible for extracting the relevant entities and relationships from each text chunk,
using the schema as guideline.

This package contains an LLM-based entity and relationships extractor: `LLMEntityRelationExtractor`.
It can be used in this way:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.entity_relation_extractor import (
        LLMEntityRelationExtractor,
    )
    from neo4j_graphrag.llm import OpenAILLM

    extractor = LLMEntityRelationExtractor(
        llm=OpenAILLM(
            model_name="gpt-4o",
            model_params={
                "max_tokens": 1000,
                "response_format": {"type": "json_object"},
            },
        )
    )
    await extractor.run(chunks=TextChunks(chunks=[TextChunk(text="some text")]))


.. warning::

    Using `OpenAILLM` requires the `openai` Python client. You can install it with `pip install "neo4j_graphrag[openai]"`.

.. warning::

    The `LLMEntityRelationExtractor` works better if `"response_format": {"type": "json_object"}` is in the model parameters.

The LLM to use can be customized, the only constraint is that it obeys the :ref:`LLMInterface <llminterface>`.

Error Behaviour
---------------

By default, if the extraction fails for one chunk, it will be ignored and the non-failing chunks will be saved.
This behaviour can be changed by using the `on_error` flag in the `LLMEntityRelationExtractor` constructor:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.entity_relation_extractor import (
        LLMEntityRelationExtractor,
        OnError,
    )

    extractor = LLMEntityRelationExtractor(
        # ...
        on_error=OnError.RAISE,
    )

In this scenario, any failing chunk will make the whole pipeline fail (for all chunks), and no data
will be saved to Neo4j.

.. _lexical-graph-in-er-extraction:

Lexical Graph
-------------

By default, the `LLMEntityRelationExtractor` also creates the :ref:`lexical graph<lexical-graph-builder>`.

If this 'lexical graph' is not desired, set the `created_lexical_graph` to `False` in the extractor constructor:

.. code:: python

    extractor = LLMEntityRelationExtractor(
        llm=....,
        create_lexical_graph=False,
    )


.. note::

    - If `self.create_lexical_graph` is set to `True`, the complete lexical graph
      will be created, including the document and chunk nodes, along with the relationships
      between entities and the chunk they were extracted from.
    - If `self.create_lexical_graph` is set to `False` but `lexical_graph_config`
      is provided, the document and chunk nodes won't be created. However, relationships
      between chunks and the entities extracted from them will still be added to the graph.

.. warning::

    If omitting `self.create_lexical_graph` and the chunk does not exist,
    this will result in no relationship being created in the database by the writer.


Customizing the Prompt
----------------------

The default prompt uses the :ref:`erextractiontemplate`. It is possible to provide a custom prompt as string:

.. code:: python

    extractor = LLMEntityRelationExtractor(
        llm=....,
        prompt="Extract entities from {text}",
    )

The following variables can be used in the prompt:

- `text` (str): the text to be analyzed (mandatory).
- `schema` (str): the graph schema to be used.
- `examples` (str): examples for few-shot learning.


Subclassing the EntityRelationExtractor
---------------------------------------

If more customization is needed, it is possible to subclass the `EntityRelationExtractor` interface:

.. code:: python

    from pydantic import validate_call
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.entity_relation_extractor import EntityRelationExtractor
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.schema import SchemaConfig
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.types import (
        Neo4jGraph,
        Neo4jNode,
        Neo4jRelationship,
        TextChunks,
    )

    class MyExtractor(EntityRelationExtractor):

        @validate_call
        async def run(self, chunks: TextChunks, **kwargs: Any) -> Neo4jGraph:
            return Neo4jGraph(
                nodes=[
                    Neo4jNode(id="0", label="Person", properties={"name": "A. Einstein"}),
                    Neo4jNode(id="1", label="Concept", properties={"name": "Theory of relativity"}),
                ],
                relationships=[
                    Neo4jRelationship(type="PROPOSED_BY", start_node_id="1", end_node_id="0", properties={"year": 1915})
                ],
            )


See :ref:`entityrelationextractor`.


.. _kg-writer-section:

Knowledge Graph Writer
======================

KG writer are used to save the results of the `EntityRelationExtractor`.
The main implementation is the `Neo4jWriter` that will write nodes and relationships
to a Neo4j database:

.. code:: python

    import neo4j
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.kg_writer import Neo4jWriter
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.types import Neo4jGraph

    with neo4j.GraphDatabase.driver(
        "bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password")
    ) as driver:
        writer = Neo4jWriter(driver)
        graph = Neo4jGraph(nodes=[], relationships=[])
        await writer.run(graph)

Adjust the batch_size parameter of `Neo4jWriter` to optimize insert performance.
This parameter controls the number of nodes or relationships inserted per batch, with a default value of 1000.

See :ref:`neo4jgraph`.


It is possible to create a custom writer using the `KGWriter` interface:

.. code:: python

    import json
    from pydantic import validate_call
    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.kg_writer import KGWriter

    class JsonWriter(KGWriter):

        def __init__(self, file_name: str) -> None:
            self.file_name = file_name

        @validate_call
        async def run(self, graph: Neo4jGraph) -> KGWriterModel:
            try:
                with open(self.file_name, "w") as f:
                    json.dump(graph.model_dump(), f, indent=2)
                return KGWriterModel(status="SUCCESS")
            except Exception:
                return KGWriterModel(status="FAILURE")


.. note::

    The `validate_call` decorator is required when the input parameter contain a `Pydantic` model.


See :ref:`kgwritermodel` and :ref:`kgwriter` in API reference.


Entity Resolver
===============

The KG Writer component creates new nodes for each identified entity
without making assumptions about entity similarity. The Entity Resolver
is responsible for refining the created knowledge graph by merging entity
nodes that represent the same real-world object.

In practice, this package implements a simple resolver that merges nodes
with the same label and identical "name" property.

.. warning::

    The `SinglePropertyExactMatchResolver` **replaces** the nodes created by the KG writer.


It can be used like this:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.resolver import (
        SinglePropertyExactMatchResolver,
    )
    resolver = SinglePropertyExactMatchResolver(driver)
    res = await resolver.run()

.. warning::

    By default, all nodes with the `__Entity__` label will be resolved.
    This behavior can be controled using the `filter_query` parameter described below.

Filter Query Parameter
----------------------

To exclude specific nodes from the resolution, a `filter_query` can be added to the query.
For example, if a `:Resolved` label has been applied to already resolved entities
in the graph, these entities can be excluded with the following approach:

.. code:: python

    from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.components.resolver import (
        SinglePropertyExactMatchResolver,
    )
    filter_query = "WHERE NOT entity:Resolved"
    resolver = SinglePropertyExactMatchResolver(driver, filter_query=filter_query)
    res = await resolver.run()


Similar approach can be used to exclude entities created from a previous pipeline
run on the same document, assuming a label `OldDocument` has been assigned to the
previously created document node:

.. code:: python

    filter_query = "WHERE NOT EXISTS((entity)-[:FROM_DOCUMENT]->(:OldDocument))"
