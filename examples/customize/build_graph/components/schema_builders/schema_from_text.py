"""This example demonstrates how to use the SchemaFromTextExtractor component
to automatically extract a schema from text and save it to JSON and YAML files.

The SchemaFromTextExtractor component uses an LLM to analyze the text and identify entities,
relations, and their properties.

Note: This example requires an OpenAI API key to be set in the .env file.

Acme Corporation was founded in 1985 by John Smith in New York City.
The company specializes in manufacturing high-quality widgets and gadgets
for the consumer electronics industry.

Sarah Johnson joined Acme in 2010 as a Senior Engineer and was promoted to
Engineering Director in 2015. She oversees a team of 12 engineers working on
next-generation products. Sarah holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering from MIT
and has filed 5 patents during her time at Acme.

The company expanded to international markets in 2012, opening offices in London,
Tokyo, and Berlin. Each office is managed by a regional director who reports
directly to the CEO, Michael Brown, who took over leadership in 2008.

Acme's most successful product, the SuperWidget X1, was launched in 2018 and
has sold over 2 million units worldwide. The product was developed by a team led
by Robert Chen, who joined the company in 2016 after working at TechGiant for 8 years.

The company currently employs 250 people across its 4 locations and had a revenue
of $75 million in the last fiscal year. Acme is planning to go public in 2024
with an estimated valuation of $500 million.
