"""This example uses an example Movie database where movies' plots are embedded
using OpenAI embeddings. OPENAI_API_KEY needs to be set in the environment for
this example to run.

Also requires minimal Cypher knowledge to write the retrieval query.

It shows how to use a vector-cypher retriever to find context
similar to a query **text** using vector similarity + graph traversal.
