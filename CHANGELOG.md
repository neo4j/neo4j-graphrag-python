- Added deprecation warnings to async_upsert_vector, async_upsert_vector_on_relationship functions notifying developers that they will be removed in a future release.
- Added support for database, timeout, and sanitize arguments in schema functions.

### Fixed

- Resolved an issue with an incorrectly hard coded node alias in the `_handle_field_filter` function.

## 1.4.3

### Added

- Added py.typed so that mypy knows to use type annotations from the neo4j-graphrag package.
- Support for creating enhanced schemas with detailed property statistics.
- New utility functions for schema formatting and value sanitization.
- Updated unit and integration tests to cover enhanced schema functionality.

### Changed

- Changed the default behaviour of `FixedSizeSplitter` to avoid words cut-off in the chunks whenever it is possible.
- Refactored schema creation code to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

### Fixed

- Removed the `uuid` package from dependencies (not needed with Python 3).
- Fixed a bug in the `AnthropicLLM` class preventing it from being used in `GraphRAG` pipeline.

## 1.4.2

### Fixed

- Fix a bug where the `OllamaEmbedder` would return a `list[list[float]]` instead of the expected `list[float]`.

## 1.4.1

### Fixed

#### Dependencies

- PyYAML dependency was missing and has been added.
- Weaviate was unintentionally added as a mandatory dependency in previous version, this behavior has been reverted.
- PyPDF and fsspec are not optional anymore so that SimpleKGPipeline examples can run out of the box (they just require the independent installation of openai python package if using OpenAI).

## 1.4.0

### Added
- Support for conversations with message history, including a new `message_history` parameter for LLM interactions.
- Ability to include system instructions in LLM invoke method.
- Summarization of chat history to enhance query embedding and context handling in GraphRAG.

### Changed
- Updated LLM implementations to handle message history consistently across providers.
- The `id_prefix` parameter in the `LexicalGraphConfig` is deprecated.

### Fixed
- IDs for the Document and Chunk nodes in the lexical graph are now randomly generated and unique across multiple runs, fixing issues in the lexical graph where relationships were created between chunks that were created by different pipeline runs.
- Improve logging for a better debugging experience: long lists and strings are now truncated. The max length can be controlled using the `LOGGING__MAX_LIST_LENGTH` and `LOGGING__MAX_STRING_LENGTH` env variables.

## 1.3.0

### Added
- Integrated `json-repair` package to handle and repair invalid JSON generated by LLMs.
- Introduced `InvalidJSONError` exception for handling cases where JSON repair fails.

- Added `OllamaLLM` and `OllamaEmbeddings` classes to make Ollama support more explicit. Implementations using the `OpenAILLM` and `OpenAIEmbeddings` classes will still work.

### Changed
- Updated LLM prompt for Entity and Relation extraction to include stricter instructions for generating valid JSON.

### Fixed
- Added schema functions to the documentation.

## 1.2.1

### Added

### Fixed
- `neo4j_database` parameter is now used for all queries in the `Neo4jWriter`.

### Changed
- Updated all examples to use `neo4j_database` parameter instead of an undocumented neo4j driver constructor.
- All `READ` queries are now routed to a reader replica (for clusters). This impacts all retrievers, the `Neo4jChunkReader` and `SinglePropertyExactMatchResolver` components.

### Added
- Made `relations` and `potential_schema` optional in `SchemaBuilder`.
- Added a check to prevent the use of deprecated Cypher syntax for Neo4j versions 5.23.0 and above.
- Added a `LexicalGraphBuilder` component to enable the import of the lexical graph (document, chunks) without performing entity and relation extraction.
- Added a `Neo4jChunkReader` component to be able to read chunk text from the database.

### Changed
- Vector and Hybrid retrievers used with `return_properties` now also return the node labels (`nodeLabels`) and the node's element ID (`id`).
- `HybridRetriever` now filters out the embedding property index in `self.vector_index_name` from the retriever result by default.

- Updated examples and unit tests to reflect the removal of async driver support.

### Fixed
- Resolved issue with `AzureOpenAIEmbeddings` incorrectly inheriting from `OpenAIEmbeddings`, now inherits from `BaseOpenAIEmbeddings`.

## 1.1.0

### Added
- Introduced a `fail_if_exist` option to index creation functions to control behavior when an index already exists.
- Added Qdrant retriever in neo4j_graphrag.retrievers.

- Added the `SimpleKGPipeline` class, a simplified abstraction layer to streamline knowledge graph building processes from text documents.

## 1.0.0a1

## 1.0.0a0

### Added

- `custom_prompt` arg is now converted to `Text2CypherTemplate` class within the `Text2CypherRetriever.get_search_results` method.
- `Text2CypherTemplate` and `RAGTemplate` prompt templates now require `query_text` arg and will error if it is not present. Previous `query_text` aliases may be used, but will warn of deprecation.
- Resolved issue where Neo4jWriter component would raise an error if the start or end node ID was not defined properly in the input.
- Resolved issue where relationship types was not escaped in the insert Cypher query.
- Improved query performance in Neo4jWriter: created nodes now have a generic `__KGBuilder__` label and an index is created on the `__KGBuilder__.id` property. Moreover, insertion queries are now batched. Batch size can be controlled using the `batch_size` parameter in the `Neo4jWriter` component.

### Changed
- Moved the Embedder class to the neo4j_graphrag.embeddings directory for better organization alongside other custom embedders.
- Removed query argument from the GraphRAG class' `.search` method; users must now use `query_text`.
