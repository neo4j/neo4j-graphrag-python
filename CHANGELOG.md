# @neo4j/neo4j-graphrag-python

## Next

### Changed

- Switched project/dependency management from Poetry to uv.
- Dropped support for Python 3.9 (EOL)


## 1.11.0

### Added

- Added an optional `node_label_neo4j` parameter in the external retrievers to speed up the search query in Neo4j.

- Exposed optional `sample` parameter on `get_schema` and `get_structured_schema` to control APOC sampling for schema discovery.
- Added an optional `id_property_getter` callable parameter in the Qdrant retriever to allow for custom ID retrieval.

## 1.10.1

### Added

- Added automatic rate limiting with retry logic and exponential backoff for all Embedding providers using tenacity. The `RateLimitHandler` interface allows for custom rate limiting strategies, including the ability to disable rate limiting entirely.
- JSON response returned to `SchemaFromTextExtractor` is cleansed of any markdown code blocks before being loaded.

## 1.10.0

### Added

- Added a `ToolsRetriever` retriever that uses an LLM to decide on what tools to use to find the relevant data.
- Added `convert_to_tool` method to the `Retriever` interface to convert a Retriever to a Tool so it can be used within the ToolsRetriever. This is useful when you might want to have both a VectorRetriever and a Text2CypherRetreiver as a fallback.
- Added `schema_visualization` function to visualize a graph schema using neo4j-viz.

### Fixed

- Fixed an edge case where the LLM can output a property with type 'map', which was causing errors during import as it is not a valid property type in Neo4j.


### Added

- Document node is now always created when running SimpleKGPipeline, even if `from_pdf=False`.
- Document metadata is exposed in SimpleKGPipeline run method.


## 1.9.1

### Fixed

- Fixed documentation for PdfLoader
- Fixed a bug where the `format` argument for `OllamaLLM` was not propagated to the client.
- Fixed `AttributeError` in `SchemaFromTextExtractor` when filtering out node/relationship types with no labels.
- Fixed an import error in `VertexAIEmbeddings`.

## 1.9.0

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where Session nodes were duplicated.

## Added

- Added automatic rate limiting with retry logic and exponential backoff for all LLM providers using tenacity. The `RateLimitHandler` interface allows for custom rate limiting strategies, including the ability to disable rate limiting entirely.

## 1.8.0

### Added

- Support for Python 3.13
- Added support for automatic schema extraction from text using LLMs. In the `SimpleKGPipeline`, when the user provides no schema, the automatic schema extraction is enabled by default.
- Added ability to return a user-defined message if context is empty in GraphRAG (which skips the LLM call).

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where `spacy` and `rapidfuzz` needed to be installed even if not using the relevant entity resolvers.
- Fixed a bug where `VertexAILLM.(a)invoke_with_tools` called with multiple tools would raise an error.

### Changed

#### Strict mode

- Strict mode in `SimpleKGPipeline`: the `enforce_schema` option is removed and replaced by a schema-driven pruning.

#### Schema definition

- The `SchemaEntity` model has been renamed `NodeType`.
- The `SchemaRelation` model has been renamed `RelationshipType`.
- The `SchemaProperty` model has been renamed `PropertyType`.
- `SchemaConfig` has been removed in favor of `GraphSchema` (used in the `SchemaBuilder` and `EntityRelationExtractor` classes). `entities`, `relations` and `potential_schema` fields have also been renamed `node_types`, `relationship_types` and `patterns` respectively.

#### Other

- The reserved `id` property on `__KGBuilder__` nodes is removed.
- The `chunk_index` property on `__Entity__` nodes is removed. Use the `FROM_CHUNK` relationship instead.
- The `__entity__id` index is not used anymore and can be dropped from the database (it has been replaced by `__entity__tmp_internal_id`).


## 1.7.0

### Added

- Added tool calling functionality to the LLM base class with OpenAI and VertexAI implementations, enabling structured parameter extraction and function calling.
- Added support for multi-vector collection in Qdrant driver.
- Added a `Pipeline.stream` method to stream pipeline progress.
- Added a new semantic match resolver to the KG Builder for entity resolution based on spaCy embeddings and cosine similarities so that nodes with similar textual properties get merged.
- Added a new fuzzy match resolver to the KG Builder for entity resolution based on RapiFuzz string fuzzy matching.

### Changed

- Improved log output readability in Retrievers and GraphRAG and added embedded vector to retriever result metadata for debugging.
- Switched from pygraphviz to neo4j-viz
    -   Renders interactive graph now on HTML instead of PNG
    -   Removed `get_pygraphviz_graph` method

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the `$nin` operator for metadata pre-filtering in retrievers would create an invalid Cypher query.


## 1.6.1

### Added

- Added the `run_with_context` method to `Component`. This method includes a `context_` parameter, which provides information about the pipeline from which the component is executed (e.g., the `run_id`). It also enables the component to send events to the pipeline's callback function.

### Fixed

- Added `enforce_schema` parameter to `SimpleKGPipeline` for optional schema enforcement.

## 1.4.1

### Fixed

#### Dependencies

- PyYAML dependency was missing and has been added.
- Weaviate was unintentionally added as a mandatory dependency in previous version, this behavior has been reverted.
- PyPDF and fsspec are not optional anymore so that SimpleKGPipeline examples can run out of the box (they just require the independent installation of openai python package if using OpenAI).

### Changed
- Updated all examples to use `neo4j_database` parameter instead of an undocumented neo4j driver constructor.
