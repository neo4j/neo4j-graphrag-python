# Neo4j GraphRAG package for Python

This repository contains the official Neo4j GraphRAG features for Python.

The purpose of this package is to provide a first party package to developers,
where Neo4j can guarantee long term commitment and maintenance as well as being
fast to ship new features and high performing patterns and methods.

Documentation: https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/

Python versions supported:

* Python 3.12 supported.
* Python 3.11 supported.
* Python 3.10 supported.
* Python 3.9 supported.

# Usage

## Installation

This package requires Python (>=3.9).

To install the latest stable version, use:

```shell
pip install neo4j-graphrag
```

### Optional dependencies

#### pygraphviz

`pygraphviz` is used for visualizing pipelines.
Follow installation instructions [here](https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html).

## Examples

### Knowledge graph construction

**NOTE: The [APOC core library](https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/) must be installed in your Neo4j instance in order to use this feature**

Assumption: Neo4j running

```python
import asyncio

from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j_graphrag.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.pipeline.kg_builder import SimpleKGPipeline
from neo4j_graphrag.llm.openai_llm import OpenAILLM

# Connect to Neo4j database
URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
AUTH = ("neo4j", "password")
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH)

# Instantiate Entity and Relation objects
entities = ["Person", "House", "Planet"]
relations = ["PARENT_OF", "HEIR_OF", "RULES"]
potential_schema = [
    ("Person", "PARENT_OF", "Person"),
    ("Person", "HEIR_OF", "House"),
    ("House", "RULES", "Planet"),
]

# Instantiate an Embedder object
embedder = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")

# Instantiate the LLM
llm = OpenAILLM(
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    model_params={
        "max_tokens": 2000,
        "response_format": {"type": "json_object"},
        "temperature": 0,
    },
)

# Instantiate the SimpleKGPipeline
kg_builder = SimpleKGPipeline(
    llm=llm,
    driver=driver,
    embedder=embedder,
    entities=entities,
    relations=relations,
    on_error="IGNORE",
    from_pdf=False,
)

asyncio.run(
    kg_builder.run_async(
        text=""""The son of Duke Leto Atreides and the Lady Jessica, Paul is the heir of
        House Atreides, an aristocratic family that rules the planet Caladan."""
    )
)
```

### Creating a vector index

When creating a vector index, make sure you match the number of dimensions in the index with the number of dimensions the embeddings have.

Assumption: Neo4j running

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j_graphrag.indexes import create_vector_index

URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
AUTH = ("neo4j", "password")

INDEX_NAME = "vector-index-name"

# Connect to Neo4j database
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH)

# Creating the index
create_vector_index(
    driver,
    INDEX_NAME,
    label="Document",
    embedding_property="vectorProperty",
    dimensions=1536,
    similarity_fn="euclidean",
)

```

### Populating the Neo4j Vector Index

Note that the below example is not the only way you can upsert data into your Neo4j database. For example, you could also leverage [the Neo4j Python driver](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver).

Assumption: Neo4j running with a defined vector index

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j_graphrag.indexes import upsert_vector

URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
AUTH = ("neo4j", "password")

# Connect to Neo4j database
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH)

# Upsert the vector
vector = ...
upsert_vector(
    driver,
    node_id=1,
    embedding_property="vectorProperty",
    vector=vector,
)
```

### Performing a similarity search

Assumption: Neo4j running with populated vector index in place.

Limitation: The query over the vector index is an _approximate_ nearest neighbor search and may not give exact results. [See this reference for more details](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/vector-indexes/#limitations-and-issues).

While the library has more retrievers than shown here, the following examples should be able to get you started.

In the following example, we use a simple vector search as retriever,
that will perform a similarity search over the `index-name` vector index
in Neo4j.

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j_graphrag.retrievers import VectorRetriever
from neo4j_graphrag.llm import OpenAILLM
from neo4j_graphrag.generation import GraphRAG
from neo4j_graphrag.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
AUTH = ("neo4j", "password")

INDEX_NAME = "vector-index-name"

# Connect to Neo4j database
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH)

# Create Embedder object
embedder = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")

# Initialize the retriever
retriever = VectorRetriever(driver, INDEX_NAME, embedder)

# Initialize the LLM
# Note: An OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is required here
llm = OpenAILLM(model_name="gpt-4o", model_params={"temperature": 0})

# Initialize the RAG pipeline
rag = GraphRAG(retriever=retriever, llm=llm)

# Query the graph
query_text = "How do I do similarity search in Neo4j?"
response = rag.search(query_text=query_text, retriever_config={"top_k": 5})
print(response.answer)
```

# Development

    -   Major changes:
        -   New features
        -   Bug fixes with high impact
        -   Breaking changes
    -   Minor changes:
        -   Documentation improvements
        -   Code refactoring without functional impact
        -   Minor bug fixes
-   Keep `CHANGELOG.md` changes brief and focus on the most important changes.

### Updating the `CHANGELOG.md`

1. When opening a PR, you can generate an edit suggestion by commenting on the GitHub PR [using CodiumAI](https://github.com/CodiumAI-Agent):

```
@CodiumAI-Agent /update_changelog
```

2. Use this as a suggestion and update the `CHANGELOG.md` content under 'Next'.
3. Commit the changes.

## Run tests

### Unit tests

This should run out of the box once the dependencies are installed.

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/unit
```

### E2E tests

To run e2e tests you'd need to have some services running locally:

-   neo4j
-   weaviate
-   weaviate-text2vec-transformers

The easiest way to get it up and running is via Docker compose:

```bash
docker compose -f tests/e2e/docker-compose.yml up
```

_(pro tip: if you suspect something in the databases are cached, run `docker compose -f tests/e2e/docker-compose.yml down` to remove them completely)_

Once the services are running, execute the following command to run the e2e tests.

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/e2e
```
