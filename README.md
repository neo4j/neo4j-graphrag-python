# Neo4j GraphRAG Package for Python

The official Neo4j GraphRAG package for Python enables developers to build [graph retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG)](https://neo4j.com/blog/graphrag-manifesto/) applications using the power of Neo4j and Python.
As a first-party library, it offers a robust, feature-rich, and high-performance solution, with the added assurance of long-term support and maintenance directly from Neo4j.

```

### Optional Dependencies

#### pygraphviz

`pygraphviz` is used for visualizing pipelines.
Installation instructions can be found [here](https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html).

## üíª Example Usage

The scripts below demonstrate how to get started with the package and make use of its key features.
To run these examples, ensure that you have a Neo4j instance up and running and update the `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USERNAME`, and `NEO4J_PASSWORD` variables in each script with the details of your Neo4j instance.
For the examples, make sure to export your OpenAI key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
Additional examples are available in the `examples` folder.

### Knowledge Graph Construction

**NOTE: The [APOC core library](https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/) must be installed in your Neo4j instance in order to use this feature**

This package offers two methods for constructing a knowledge graph.

The `Pipeline` class provides extensive customization options, making it ideal for advanced use cases.
See the `examples/pipeline` folder for examples of how to use this class.

For a more streamlined approach, the `SimpleKGPipeline` class offers a simplified abstraction layer over the `Pipeline`, making it easier to build knowledge graphs.
Both classes support working directly with text and PDFs.

```python
import asyncio

from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j_graphrag.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from neo4j_graphrag.experimental.pipeline.kg_builder import SimpleKGPipeline
from neo4j_graphrag.llm.openai_llm import OpenAILLM

NEO4J_URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USERNAME = "neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "password"

# Connect to the Neo4j database
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(NEO4J_URI, auth=(NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD))

# List the entities and relations the LLM should look for in the text
entities = ["Person", "House", "Planet"]
relations = ["PARENT_OF", "HEIR_OF", "RULES"]
potential_schema = [
    ("Person", "PARENT_OF", "Person"),
    ("Person", "HEIR_OF", "House"),
    ("House", "RULES", "Planet"),
]

# Create an Embedder object
embedder = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")

# Instantiate the LLM
llm = OpenAILLM(
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    model_params={
        "max_tokens": 2000,
        "response_format": {"type": "json_object"},
        "temperature": 0,
    },
)

# Instantiate the SimpleKGPipeline
kg_builder = SimpleKGPipeline(
    llm=llm,
    driver=driver,
    embedder=embedder,
    entities=entities,
    relations=relations,
    on_error="IGNORE",
    from_pdf=False,
)

# Run the pipeline on a piece of text
text = (
    "The son of Duke Leto Atreides and the Lady Jessica, Paul is the heir of House "
    "Atreides, an aristocratic family that rules the planet Caladan."
)
asyncio.run(kg_builder.run_async(text=text))
driver.close()
```

### Creating a Vector Index

When creating a vector index, make sure you match the number of dimensions in the index with the number of dimensions your embeddings have.

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j_graphrag.indexes import create_vector_index

NEO4J_URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USERNAME = "neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "password"
INDEX_NAME = "vector-index-name"

# Connect to the Neo4j database
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(NEO4J_URI, auth=(NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD))

# Create the index
create_vector_index(
    driver,
    INDEX_NAME,
    label="Chunk",
    embedding_property="embedding",
    dimensions=3072,
    similarity_fn="euclidean",
)
driver.close()
```

### Populating a Vector Index

This example demonstrates one method for upserting data in your Neo4j database.
It's important to note that there are alternative approaches, such as using the [Neo4j Python driver](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver).

Ensure that your vector index is created prior to executing this example.

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j_graphrag.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from neo4j_graphrag.indexes import upsert_vector

NEO4J_URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USERNAME = "neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "password"

# Connect to the Neo4j database
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(NEO4J_URI, auth=(NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD))

# Create an Embedder object
embedder = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")

# Generate an embedding for some text
text = (
    "The son of Duke Leto Atreides and the Lady Jessica, Paul is the heir of House "
    "Atreides, an aristocratic family that rules the planet Caladan."
)
vector = embedder.embed_query(text)

# Upsert the vector
upsert_vector(
    driver,
    node_id=0,
    embedding_property="embedding",
    vector=vector,
)
driver.close()
```

### Performing a Similarity Search

Please note that when querying a Neo4j vector index _approximate_ nearest neighbor search is used, which may not always deliver exact results.
For more information, refer to the Neo4j documentation on [limitations and issues of vector indexes](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/vector-indexes/#limitations-and-issues).

In the example below, we perform a simple vector search using a retriever that conducts a similarity search over the `vector-index-name` vector index.

This library provides more retrievers beyond just the `VectorRetriever`.
See the `examples` folder for examples of how to use these retrievers.

Before running this example, make sure your vector index has been created and populated.

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j_graphrag.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from neo4j_graphrag.generation import GraphRAG
from neo4j_graphrag.llm import OpenAILLM
from neo4j_graphrag.retrievers import VectorRetriever

NEO4J_URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USERNAME = "neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "password"
INDEX_NAME = "vector-index-name"

# Connect to the Neo4j database
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(NEO4J_URI, auth=(NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD))

# Create an Embedder object
embedder = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")

# Initialize the retriever
retriever = VectorRetriever(driver, INDEX_NAME, embedder)

# Instantiate the LLM
llm = OpenAILLM(model_name="gpt-4o", model_params={"temperature": 0})

# Instantiate the RAG pipeline
rag = GraphRAG(retriever=retriever, llm=llm)

# Query the graph
query_text = "Who is Paul Atreides?"
response = rag.search(query_text=query_text, retriever_config={"top_k": 5})
print(response.answer)
driver.close()
```

## üß™ Tests

### Unit Tests

Install the project dependencies then run the following command to run the unit tests locally:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/unit
```

### E2E tests

To execute end-to-end (e2e) tests, you need the following services to be running locally:

- neo4j
- weaviate
- weaviate-text2vec-transformers

The simplest way to set these up is by using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f tests/e2e/docker-compose.yml up
```

_(tip: If you encounter any caching issues within the databases, you can completely remove them by running `docker compose -f tests/e2e/docker-compose.yml down`)_

Once all the services are running, execute the following command to run the e2e tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/e2e
```
