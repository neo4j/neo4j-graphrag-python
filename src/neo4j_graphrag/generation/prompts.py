"relationships": [{{"type": "KNOWS", "start_node_id": "0", "end_node_id": "1", "properties": {{"since": "2024-08-01"}} }}] }}

Use only the following node and relationship types (if provided):

Assign a unique ID (string) to each node, and reuse it to define relationships.
Do respect the source and target node types for relationship and
the relationship direction.

Make sure you adhere to the following rules to produce valid JSON objects:
- Do not return any additional information other than the JSON in it.
- Omit any backticks around the JSON - simply output the JSON on its own.
- The JSON object must not wrapped into a list - it is its own JSON object.
- Property names must be enclosed in double quotes

class SchemaExtractionTemplate(PromptTemplate):
    DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = """
You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting a labeled property graph schema in
structured formats.

Generate a generalized graph schema based on the input text. Identify key node types,
their relationship types, and property types.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Return only abstract schema information, not concrete instances.
2. Use singular PascalCase labels for node types (e.g., Person, Company, Product).
3. Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE labels for relationship types (e.g., WORKS_FOR, MANAGES).
4. PROPERTY EXTRACTION:
    4.1 Analyze each node type and identify properties that would meaningfully describe or distinguish instances of that type.
    4.2 Consider what attributes are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied in the text for each node type.
    4.3 A node type with no properties should be rare — look carefully for attributes in the text.
    4.4 If a property is supported by the input text but you cannot confidently determine its type, use type STRING (do not omit solely due to type uncertainty). If a property is not supported by the input text, omit it.
    4.5 Do not remove a node type just because you cannot confidently extract any properties for it. If the node type is clearly mentioned in the text, keep it and allow "properties": [].
5. When defining patterns, ensure that every node label and relationship label mentioned exists in your lists of node types and relationship types.
6. Do not create node types that aren't clearly mentioned in the text.
7. Keep your schema minimal and focused on clearly identifiable patterns in the text.
8. UNIQUENESS CONSTRAINTS:
    8.1 UNIQUENESS is optional; each node_type may or may not have exactly one uniqueness constraint.
    8.2 Only use properties that seem to not have too many missing values in the sample.
    8.3 Constraints reference node_types by label and specify which property is unique.
    8.4 If a property appears in a uniqueness constraint it MUST also appear in the corresponding node_type as a property.
9. REQUIRED PROPERTIES:
    9.1 Mark a property as "required": true if every instance of that node/relationship type MUST have this property (non-nullable).
    9.2 Mark a property as "required": false if the property is optional and may be absent on some instances.
    9.3 Properties that are identifiers, names, or essential characteristics are typically required.
    9.4 Properties that are supplementary information (phone numbers, descriptions, metadata) are typically optional.
    9.5 When uncertain, default to "required": false.
    9.6 If a property has a UNIQUENESS constraint, it MUST be marked as "required": true.

Accepted property types are: BOOLEAN, DATE, DURATION, FLOAT, INTEGER, LIST,
LOCAL_DATETIME, LOCAL_TIME, POINT, STRING, ZONED_DATETIME, ZONED_TIME.

Return a valid JSON object that follows this precise structure:
{{
  "node_types": [
    {{
      "label": "Person",
      "properties": [
        {{
          "name": "name",
